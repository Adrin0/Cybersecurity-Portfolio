# Website Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview
This is a simple automated vulnerability scanner implemented in Python. The application allows users to gather security-related information about target domains, including domain information, IP address resolution, port scanning, WHOIS lookup, and robots.txt retrieval. The program generates a report with all gathered information, providing a foundation for cybersecurity assessments.

## Features
- **Domain Information Gathering**: Extracts the domain name and IP address from a target URL.
- **Port Scanning**: Uses Nmap to identify open ports on the target IP address.
- **WHOIS Lookup**: Retrieves WHOIS information for the target domain to identify ownership and registration details.
- **robots.txt Retrieval**: Accesses and displays the robots.txt file of the target domain to reveal restricted paths for search engines.
- **Report Generation**: Compiles all gathered information into a report.


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
   - urllib
   - io
   - nmap (requires the Nmap tool installed on your system)
   - whois (Python package or external tool, depending on your implementation)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   - git clone [https://github.com/Adrin0/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/tree/main/website-vulnerability-scanner](https://github.com/Adrin0/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/tree/main/website-vulnerability-scanner)

   - cd automated-vulnerability-scanner

2. Run the main script: python main.py

3. Follow the prompts or adjust main2.py to specify target domains, and review the generated report for the gathered security data.
